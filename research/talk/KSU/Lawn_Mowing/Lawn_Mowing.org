* Summary
[cite:@LawnMowing]

Continuous generalization of the traveling salesman problem (TSP).

Tour starts and ends at the same point, covers every point.

* Prerequisites

- Galois groups
- Abelian property
- Polyminoes
- Minkowski sums

** Galois groups

*Polynomials are solvable by radicals iff they have enough symmetry.*

*i.e. iff their Galois group is abelian (commutative)*

Polynomials of order < 5 are algebraically *easy*
- Can be solved by radicals
\( \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \)

Most polynomials of order â‰¥ 5 are algebraically *hard*
- Cannot be solved by radicals

** Polyminoes

Generalized dominoes.

Shapes made up of pixels.

** Minkowski sums

\(
{\color{red} R} = {\color{green} G} \bigoplus {\color{blue} B} = \{ \mathbf g + \mathbf b\ |\ \mathbf g \in {\color{green} G},\ \mathbf b \in {\color{blue} B} \}
\)

** Traveling Salesperson

Problem is now reduced to the traveling salesperson problem. *Solution:*

- Integer Programming (IP)
- Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)

** Lower & Upper Bounds

* Conclusion

*Already proven:*

- the optimal tour of a polygon is polygonal itself

*Proven in this paper*

- the coordinates are algebraically hard

*Future research:*

- Better lower bounds
